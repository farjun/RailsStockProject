# Rails Stock Project

During an intensive 3 months bootcamp, covering industry-level skills and hands-on practice at **Project Rails**, which through them i learnt Python and Django in a month, then i started working with another two teammates : I was a part of developing a stock trading platform using python and django for back-end, and html, css, and javascript for front-end.
